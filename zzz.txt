   What is Sentry and why is it important for developers? Sentry is an error 
   monitoring platform designed to help
    developers quickly detect, diagnose and resolve problems in their applications.

    we have used sentr for the banking purposes as ther should be no pblm in transaction and all
    sentry user ka record krti h i kse aaya usme error , uski activity record krta hor kha pr error 
     aya h bttata h pr code nhi dikhata kyooki banking m wo bhut secure rhna chahiye

     we can also see the user feedback if we have made naything fromm where we can take that
     it reocrdds all activity and shows it to you with the DoM

     using this we can track almost everything , like from which country we are geting the most 
      problems in the website , which browser is not respondin ght best , in terms of percentage as well 
      user experience  trakc it and fix it , it brings everything onto your table
